# Tutorial: Get started using RiotBlossom with a console application

This totes awesome tutorial will show you how to install RiotBlossom and make a request to the Riot Games API with a console application!

You will learn how to:
- Create a console project
- Setup RiotBlossom
- Fetch data from `summoner-v4`
- Run the app

## Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- Riot Games Development API key
- [Riot Games Developer Policies](https://developer.riotgames.com/policies/general)
- [Riot Games Developer Portal Documentation](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal)

## Create a console project
Open your preferred shell and enter the following command:

```bash
dotnet new console
```

This command will create source files within the current directory.

## Setup RiotBlossom

We will first need to install RiotBlossom from nuget.org, an online NuGet package repository for .NET apps.

```bash
dotnet add package BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom
```

With the package added, we can now fetch data from `summoner-v4`!

## Fetching data from `summoner-v4`

Open `Program.cs` and add the following code:

```csharp
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Client;
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Data.Constants.Shards;

// RIOT_API_KEY environment variable is automatically used!
var client = RiotBlossomClient.Create();

var summoner = await client.SummonerV4.GetByNameAsync(LeagueShard.NA1, "uwuie time");

Console.WriteLine(summoner);
```

## Run the app

Run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

It should result in something similar to this:

```json
SummonerDto {
  "AccountId": "0WvZHECxpBFNlntYzcCNyDkGeaqA6vthcLsklngrPVYofWE",
  "ProfileIconId": 5367,
  "RevisionDate": 1675651090000,
  "Name": "uwuie time",
  "Id": "Ao5ffQ2dOV-99YKs_iB0g2EGzGD159jXIk2Z5MjvMafLwbQ",
  "Puuid": "Bd1zj7cFt3MlCZl2GI-5N94D2PHRsfpsjl-6ZM9LjXIm90Bz4JAdwR6Kw4fzbSPFfLoQI5p9hGIhfA",
  "SummonerLevel": 936
}
```
