# Tutorial: Setting up application configuration in RiotBlossom

This coolsies tutorial will show you the basics of creating a client with RiotBlossom using basic and advanced configuration!

## Prerequisites

- Get Started (one of the following)
  - [Console](/get-started/console)
  - [Razor Pages](/get-started/razor-pages)
  - [Web API](/get-started/web-api)

::alert{type="warning"}
For both minimal and advanced configurations, you can optionally omit the Riot API key if you're only interested in using the static data services (DataDragon, CommunityDragon, or Meraki Analytics).

Do note that an exception will be thrown when attempting to access an endpoint without a key!

## Create a client using minimal configuration

To create a client with the least configuration possible:

```csharp
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Client;

var client = RiotBlossomClient.Create();
```

Wowie, that was *sooo* easy!

By default, RiotBlossom will attempt to extract the Riot API key from an environment variable named `RIOT_API_KEY`. Memory caching, burst rate limiting, and retrying are also enabled by default. An `HttpClient` will also be created internally for making web requests with.

## Create a client with advanced configuration

Creating a client with advanced configuration is as simple as this:

```csharp
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Client;
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Core;
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Core.Cache;
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Core.Limiting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

var client = RiotBlossomClient.Create(new ApiConfiguration()
{
  Key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("RIOT_API_KEY"),
  Cache = CacheFactory.Create(CacheProvider.Memory),
  Limiter = LimiterFactory.Create(LimiterProvider.Burst),
  Logger = LoggerFactory.Create(configure =>
  {
    configure.AddConsole();
  }).CreateLogger("RiotBlossom"),
  Http = new()
  {
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)
  }
});
```
