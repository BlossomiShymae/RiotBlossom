## Fetch a summoner

Let us try getting a summoner from the Riot API! Type and save the following code below:

```csharp
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Data.Constants.Shards;

var summoner = await client.SummonerV4.GetByNameAsync(LeagueShard.NA1, "uwuie time");
```

Similar output should be displayed within your console:

```json
SummonerDto {
  "AccountId": "0WvZHECxpBFNlntYzcCNyDkGeaqA6vthcLsklngrPVYofWE",
  "ProfileIconId": 5367,
  "RevisionDate": 1675651090000,
  "Name": "uwuie time",
  "Id": "Ao5ffQ2dOV-99YKs_iB0g2EGzGD159jXIk2Z5MjvMafLwbQ",
  "Puuid": "Bd1zj7cFt3MlCZl2GI-5N94D2PHRsfpsjl-6ZM9LjXIm90Bz4JAdwR6Kw4fzbSPFfLoQI5p9hGIhfA",
  "SummonerLevel": 936
}
```

The preceding string is generated with the `PrettyPrinter` class provided by `RiotBlossom.Core.Utils`. This makes it totes friendly and easier for reading data objects from the console!

## Fetch match identifiers and matches

Now how about getting some fresh matches with the summoner we received? >w<

Go ahead and save the following code below:
