# Tutorial: Making requests to DataDragon in RiotBlossom

DataDragon is Riot Games' static content delivery network that provides assets for 
their game titles. In short, it provides images and information for stuffies like 
League of Legends champions, runes, items, and more!

You will learn how to:
- Fetch game versions
- Fetch a champion meta info
- Fetch a perk meta info
- Fetch an item meta info dictionary

## Prerequisites

- DataDragon section of the following official documentation
  - [League of Legends](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#data-dragon)
  - [Teamfight Tactics](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/tft#static-data)
  - [Legends of Runeterra](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lor#data-dragon)
- Tutorials Overview

## Fetch game versions

DataDragon follows API versioning to ensure changes are made without disruption. 
Versions usually follow the format of a League of Legends patch e.g. `12.23`. We 
will be calling this a game version.

To fetch the list of game versions, type and save the following code below:

```csharp
var versions = await client.DataDragon.ListVersionsAsync();
```

The latest game version is the first on the list. Since this version is usually what 
developers need, RiotBlossom offers a convenience method that allows you to do this:

```csharp
var version = await client.DataDragon.GetLatestVersionAsync();

// The above line is just a shorter way of doing this~
var versions = await client.DataDragon.ListVersionsAsync();
var version = versions.First();
```

## Fetch a champion meta info

Now that we have our latest game version, we can now get champion information!

Gwen has the champion ID of `887`. Let us try to find out more about her:

```csharp
var champion = await client.DataDragon.GetChampionByIdAsync(version, 887);
Console.WriteLine(champion);
```

The following should be displayed within the console:

```json
Champion {
  "Id": "Gwen",
  "Key": "887",
  "Name": "Gwen",
  "Title": "The Hallowed Seamstress",
  "Image": {
    "Full": "Gwen.png",
    "Sprite": "champion1.png",       
    "Group": "champion",
    "X": 432,
    "Y": 0,
    "W": 48,
    "H": 48
  },
  ...
}
```

It would be excellent to cache the champion hash map so that it is not requested 
each time we need to get champion information:

```csharp
var championDictionary = await client.DataDragon.GetChampionDictionaryAsync(version);
var champion = championDictionary[887];
```

## Fetch a perk meta info

League of Legends runes are also called perks.

Summon Aery has a perk ID of `8214`. Knowing that, we can do the following:

```csharp
var version = await client.DataDragon.GetLatestVersionAsync();
var perk = await client.DataDragon.GetPerkStyleByIdAsync(version, 8214);
Console.WriteLine(perk);
```

The following should be shown within your console:

```json
// TODO
```

Caching the perk style hash map would be totes amazing instead of having to 
request it each time we need to get perk style information:

```csharp
var perkStyleDictionary = await client.DataDragon.GetPerkStyleDictionaryAsync(version);
var perk = perkStyleDictionary[8214];
```

## Fetch an item meta info

League of Legends shop items are simply called items.

Moonstone Renewer has an item ID of `6617`. Let us try to do the following:

```csharp
var version = await client.DataDragon.GetLatestVersionAsync();
var item = await client.DataDragon.GetItemByIdAsync(version, 6617);
Console.WriteLine(item);
```

The console should display the following infosies:

```json
Item {
  "Name": "Moonstone Renewer",
  "Rune": {
    "IsRune": false,
    "Tier": 0,
    "Type": null
  },
  "Gold": {
    "Base": 750,
    "Total": 2500,
    "Sell": 1750,
    "Purchasable": true
  },
  ...
}
```

As always, caching is the totes better practice~*

```csharp
var itemDictionary = await client.DataDragon.GetItemDictionaryAsync(version);
var item = itemDictionary[6617];
```

Yay! Thank you for completing this tutorial!
