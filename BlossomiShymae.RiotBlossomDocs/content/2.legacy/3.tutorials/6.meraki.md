# Tutorial: Making requests to Meraki Analytics in RiotBlossom

:badge[Added in 1.2.0]

Meraki Analytics is an LLC company that provides open-source projects for the 
Riot Games Developer Community. They are most known for Java [orianna](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna), Python [cassiopeia](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia), and [lolstaticdata](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/lolstaticdata) champion and item data generator.

Meraki provides a CDN serving the latest data generated by **lolstaticdata**. More 
information about their project's mission can be found in the linked [Goals of the Project](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/lolstaticdata#goals-of-the-project) section.

In shortsies, Meraki static data aims to mediate between the data inaccuracies of 
**DataDragon** and the schema complexities of **CommunityDragon**.

You will learn how to:
- Fetch a champion 
- Fetch an item

## Fetch a champion

Fetching a champion from Meraki requires an associated `key` identifier. This is 
the same key found in **DataDragon** `key` and **CommunityDragon** `alias` analogs!

Okie dokie, let us try using the champion key for Ahri:

```csharp
var champion = await client.MerakiAnalytics.GetChampionByKeyAsync("Ahri");
Console.WriteLine(champion);
```

The following should be displayed within the console:

```json
Champion {
  "Id": 103,
  "Key": "Ahri",
  "Name": "Ahri",
  "Title": "the Nine-Tailed Fox",
  "FullName": "",
  "Icon": "http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/13.9.1/img/champion/Ahri.png",
  "Resource": "MANA",
  "AttackType": "RANGED",
  "DamageType": null,
  "Stats": {
    "Health": {
      "Flat": 590,
      "Percent": 0,
      "PerLevel": 96,
      "PercentPerLevel": 0,
      "PercentBase": 0,
      "PercentBonus": 0
    },
  ...
  }
```

::alert{type=warning}
**Oh noes**
:br
:br
A champion key is not the same as the champion name. Wukong has the champion key 
of `MonkeyKing`, for example!
::

An entire dictionary of champions from Meraki can also be fetched for caching 
purposes! <3

```csharp
var champions = await client.MerakiAnalytics.GetChampionDictionaryAsync();
var champion = champions["MonkeyKing"];
```

::alert{type=warning}
**Oh noes**
:br
:br
Getting the champion dictionary fetches an abnormally large JSON file on call. This can be significant when caching is disabled!
::

## Fetch an item

League of Legends shop items are also provided by Meraki!

How about getting some booties for item ID `1001`? ☆ ～(‘▽^人)

```csharp
var item = await client.MerakiAnalytics.GetItemByIdAsync(1001);
Console.WriteLine(item);
```

This console should display the following infosies:

```json
Item {
  "Name": "Boots",
  "Id": 1001,
  "Tier": 1,
  "Rank": [
    "BOOTS"
  ],
  "BuildsFrom": [],
  "BuildsInto": [
    3111,
    3006,
    3009,
    3020,
    3047,
    3117,
    3158
  ],
  "SpecialRecipe": 0,
  "NoEffects": true,
  "Removed": false,
  "RequiredChampion": "",
  "RequiredAlly": "",
  "Icon": "https://raw.communitydragon.org/13.9/plugins/rcp-be-lol-game-data/global/default/assets/items/icons2d/1001_class_t1_bootsofspeed.png",
  "SimpleDescription": "Slightly increases Move Speed",
  ...
}
```

As always, caching is the totes better practice~*

```csharp
var items = await client.MerakiAnalytics.GetItemDictionaryAsync();
var item = items[1001];
```

You have just learned how to fetch a champion and an item from Meraki Analytics in 
RiotBlossom!

Omega good job!
