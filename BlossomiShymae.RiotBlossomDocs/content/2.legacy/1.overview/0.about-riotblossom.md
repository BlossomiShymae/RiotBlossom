# Overview of RiotBlossom

RiotBlossom is an asynchronous, extensible, and magical Riot Games API wrapper library for C#. ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆

This library helps to make things totes' easier! Goodies include naive cache, rate limiter, and retry middleware plugins out of the box. Other services such as DataDragon and CommunityDragon are also supported! ＼(＾▽＾)／

This library is currently compatible with .NET 6 and higher.
