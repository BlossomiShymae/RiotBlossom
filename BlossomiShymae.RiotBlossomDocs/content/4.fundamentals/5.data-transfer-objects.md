# Data transfer objects (DTO)

RiotBlossom uses simple objects with no behavior for JSON deserialization. These objects are strongly typed and are 
close to 1-to-1 as possible for property names of the original data transfer objects received.

Data objects that have been commented as `UNDOCUMENTED` do not have an official schema and are likely unstable between any versions. Use at your own risk. ⚠️
