# API Interfaces in RiotBlossom

RiotBlossom serves three major API interfaces. Each of the major interfaces corresponds to an API supported by RiotBlossom:
- Riot Games --> `Riot`
- DataDragon --> `DataDragon`
- CommunityDragon --> `CommunityDragon`

This is how it corresponds to the codesies:

```csharp
using BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom.Api;

IRiotApi riotApi = client.Riot;
IDataDragonApi dataDragonApi = client.DataDragon;
ICommunityDragonApi communityDragonApi = client.CommunityDragon;
```

All API interfaces are meant for consumption, not for implementation. 
This means that you will likely have breaking changes for the implemented interface for each version!
::

## The Riot Games interface

The Riot Games interface (`Riot`) is denoted by [`IRiotApi`](https://github.com/BlossomiShymae/RiotBlossom/blob/master/BlossomiShymae.RiotBlossom/Api/RiotApi.cs).

### The manual driver

It is possible to make a low-level request via the `GetAsync` method!

```csharp
Task<T> GetAsync<T>(string route, string path);
```

This will still take full advantage of the Riot middleware plugin system features (limiting, caching, and retrying if you have them set). Just provide a type for JSON deserialization! 

( つ•̀ω•́)つ

```csharp
var summoner = await client.Riot.GetAsync<SummonerDto>("na1", "/lol/summoner/v4/summoners/by-name/uwuie time");
```

::alert{type=warning}
**Oh noes** :br

With great power comes great responsibility. Be sure that any path you use is correct!

HTTP headers can also be passed. As long as it implements `IDictionary<string, string>`!

```csharp
Task<T> GetAsync<T>(string route, string path, IDictionary<string, string> headers);
```

This should allow the use of any RSO endpoints!

```csharp
var summoner = await client.Riot.GetAsync<SummonerDto>("na1", "/lol/summoner/v4/summoners/me", new Dictionary<string, string> 
{
    { "Authorization", "Bearer token example"}
});
```
